/**
 * Factory service for RevisionStore instances. This allows RevisionStores to be created for

 *
 * @warning Beware compatibility issues with schema migration in the context of cross-wiki access!
 * This class assumes that all wikis are at compatible migration stages for all relevant schemas.
 * Relevant schemas are: revision storage (MCR), the revision comment table, and the actor table.
 * Migration stages are compatible as long as a) there are no wikis in the cluster that only write
 * the old schema or b) there are no wikis that read only the new schema.
